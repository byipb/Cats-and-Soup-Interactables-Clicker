# Python Script README

## Description
This Python script is designed to allow you to automatically detect, find and click on specific interactables on the screen. It relies on the PyAutoGUI module to move and click the mouse as well as image detection.

## Requirements
- Python

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. The script will run properly on a 2560 x 1440 monitor. If you do not have that resolution, please change the images and coordinates accordingly through the Snipping Tool. A different script for finding your mouse coordinates is also provided:
    ```
    python displayMousePos
    ```
3. Run the command prompt (cmd) in administrator mode.
4. Navigate to the directory where the script is located (example):
    ```
    cd "C:\Users\vivvy\Documents\Cats & Soup\Cats-and-Soup-Interactables-Clicker"
    ```
    If script is located in a different drive:
    ```
    cd\
    E:
    ```
5. Run the script by executing the following command:
    ```
    python findInteractables.py
    ```
6. Make sure BlueStacks is set to full-screen mode.
7. Ensure that the BlueStacks is on the main/primary screen/monitor.
8. CTRL + C to end the script.

## Important Notes
- Running the script in administrator mode may be necessary for certain operations.
- Full-screen mode and primary screen/monitor requirements are essential for the proper functioning of the script.
- The mouse cursor must be on the primary screen/monitor or else you may encounter an error.
